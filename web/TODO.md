# web/TODO

- [x] Choose UI stack (custom CSS)
- [x] Implement dark macOS-like layout shell
- [x] Swap screen: inputs, quote fetch, countdown
- [x] Bundler selector + availability indicator
- [x] Build UserOperation + signature flow
- [x] Submit to bundler + on-chain confirmation (EntryPoint logs)
- [x] Fee+gas estimation loop (paymaster-valid simulation; refine fee before signature)
- [ ] Activity list + details drawer (UserOp + decoded calls)
- [x] Failure UX: expired quote rebuild, bundler auto-failover, on-chain revert decoding (gasless-first; “pay gas yourself” offered only on failure)
- [x] Paid fallback execution: direct user-paid router swap from owner wallet
- [x] Telemetry: heartbeat (sessions) to `paymaster_monitor/server`
- [ ] Telemetry: structured events to `paymaster_monitor/server`
- [x] Dev wallet mode for automation (`VITE_DEV_PRIVATE_KEY`)
- [x] Synthetic E2E: Playwright happy-path gasless swap
- [x] Synthetic E2E: Playwright bundler failover (injected failure)
- [x] Synthetic E2E: Playwright paid fallback (gasless denial -> user-paid success)
- [x] Soak coverage via root batch runner (`scripts/soak-gasless.sh`)
- [x] Soak coverage profile for paid fallback (`SOAK_PROFILE=paid-fallback`)
- [x] Remove non-functional window control dots from titlebar
